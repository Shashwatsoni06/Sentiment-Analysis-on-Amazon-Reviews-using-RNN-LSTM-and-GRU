# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Amazon-Reviews-using-RNN-LSTM-and-GRU
This project performs sentiment analysis on the Amazon Reviews dataset using three different types of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): a simple RNN, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU). The goal is to classify reviews as either positive or negative and compare the performance of these deep learning models.
